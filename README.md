# Simple MC License Bypass Tool

### A lightweight tool for players without a Minecraft license — created because the old method got patched.

## How to Use

Download the DLL for your Minecraft version from the Releases page.

Download [ModLoader](https://github.com/alteik/ModLoader) from my github profile.

Setup it (instructions can be found on ModLoader github page)

Place mod in C:\Users\YOUR_USER\AppData\Roaming\Minecraft Bedrock\mods

note: if folder doesnt exists, start mc once for ModLoader to create it

Launch the game — it should now recognize you as licensed.

That’s it! No extra setup required.
